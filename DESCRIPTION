Description:RC class for linear regression model and Ridge regression model. The package uses ordinary least
     squares method to calculate best fitted values, estimators(coefficients), residuals,variance of the regression 
     coefficients residual variance, t values and P values using linreg class. This package also has ridgereg class
     which fits the model to find out ridge estimators and also predics the values for new data.
     Furthermore, package includes a function that visualizes
     the mean delay of airports by longitude and latitude. Finally, this package
     includes vignettes for machine learning models implemented on BostonHousing datasets and 
     predictive modelling of flight delays.
